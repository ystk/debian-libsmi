Description: extract MIB from text files like RFC
 The smistrip program is used to extract MIB and PIB module files from
 ASCII documents like RFCs or Internet Drafts. Modules are identified
 by a starting ASN.1 DEFINITIONS clause and the matching END
 clause. The output is written to files named by the modules' names.

Description: library to access SMI MIB information 
 The purpose of libsmi is to 
   * give network management applications a concise programmer-friendly
     interface to access MIB module information, 
   * separate the knowledge on SMI from the main parts of management 
     applications, 
   * allow to add new kinds of MIB repositories without the need to adapt 
     applications that make use of libsmi. 
 .
 In this context, MIB is "Management Information Base" and SMI stands for
 "Structure and identification of Management Information". See RFC1902 and
 others for details.
 .
 This package contains the main libsmi library.

Section: misc
Description: a library to access SMI MIB information - MIB module files
 This is just a transitional package to suggest snmp-mibs-downloader
 which should download needed MIB. You can delete it if you already
 have snmp-mibs-downloader.
