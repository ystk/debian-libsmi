libsmi (0.4.8+dfsg2-3) unstable; urgency=high

  MIB that were shipped in libsmi2-common were non-free: most of them
  were licensed under the same license than the corresponding IETF
  RFC. Therefore, libsmi2-common package becomes empty and suggests
  snmp-mibs-downloader instead which should propose to download MIB
  from Internet.
